      Every beginning feels softer when it starts with you.<br>
      This year didn’t arrive alone, it came carrying your name.<br>
      Some people enter our lives quietly,<br>
      yet change everything without trying.<br>
      In this moment, in this picture,<br>
      I already know you are my favorite chapter.

      Another year will pass, just like all the others.<br>
      But my feelings for you will stay untouched by time.<br>
      Through distance, silence, and chaos,<br>
      my heart still finds its way back to you.<br>
      If every year asks me what I want,<br>
      my answer will always be you.

<div class="scroll-text">
Love came into my life without any announcement, slowly becoming a part of my everyday thoughts, changing the way I looked at myself and the way I faced my struggles, because before this, I believed love had to be loud and perfect, but now I understand that real love is quiet, patient, and deeply grounding. There were times when life felt uncertain and heavy, when I questioned my worth and worried about my future, and during those moments love did not promise instant happiness, but it gave me the strength to continue even when I felt exhausted. I learned that love is not about constant joy, but about understanding, about choosing each other even on difficult days, and about staying when things feel unclear. With love, I no longer feel the need to hide my fears or pretend to be strong all the time, because acceptance feels more powerful than perfection. It taught me that growth takes time and that becoming better is a slow and honest journey, not something that happens overnight. Love exists in small moments, in quiet conversations, in shared silence, and in the comfort of knowing that someone truly sees you. It does not remove problems from life, but it changes how we face them, making challenges feel less lonely and more manageable. Even when the future feels uncertain, love gives me the courage to imagine it with hope, not because everything is planned, but because togetherness makes uncertainty easier to handle.
I Love you by Kannnukuniyal
